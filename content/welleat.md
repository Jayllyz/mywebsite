# Project Description

KBR, is an application available on smartphone, allowing to find, share and reference restaurants, brasseries and other culinary places with the aim to allow everyone to enjoy these places known or not. 

KBR is also a community platform, where everyone can add a new place, give a comment, share good tips ... It is therefore the community that makes the application live by improving the content of KBR every day. 

Once a place added by a user and validated by the moderation team, everyone can comment, give a note and use the temperature indicator to quickly show if the place is interesting or not let's sell KBR users.
