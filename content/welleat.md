# What's Well eat ?

Well eat, is an application available on smartphone, allowing you to find, share and reference restaurants, pubs and other culinary places with the aim of allowing everyone to enjoy these places, whether they are well known or not. 

Well eat is also a community platform, where everyone can add a new place, give a comment, share good advice ... 

So it is the community that brings the application to life by improving the content every day. 

Once a place is added by a user and validated by the moderation team, everyone can comment, give a note and use the temperature indicator to quickly show if the place is interesting or not.

The application is currently under development, planned for 2021. üç∫
