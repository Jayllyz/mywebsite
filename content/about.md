Hello my name is Antony, wait I forgot to do apt update && apt upgrade.... so I am currently 21 years old and I am studying at ESGI (next year in software development) after 2 years at ESIEA.  
Outside of school, I've been playing badminton as my favorite sport for 8 years. I probably spend more time looking for games than actually playing them. I like metal/rock (listen to Volbeat please).

If you want to know more about my programming projects and what I use, I invite you to visit my [github](https://github.com/Jayllyz) and my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antodavid) !
