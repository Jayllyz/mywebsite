Hello my name is Antony, I am currently 19 years old and I am studying to become an IT engineer at ESIEA.  
Outside school I made 8 years of Badminton my favorite sport and I often play games or watch series/anime.
Im actually learning :  
- Python  
- C   
- HTML / CSS & Javascript

I'm still a beginner because I've only done one year of learning C and a few sessions on web languages but
I plan to really focus on programming in the future because for the moment the preparatory cycle prevents me from developing in this field. ðŸ–¥


 Je cherche actuellement un stage dans Paris dans le domaine de l'informatique pour le mois de juillet 2021 mon [CV](https://bit.ly/2Tr03IG "Mon CV").
