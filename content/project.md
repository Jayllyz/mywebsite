The game Survive the Tempest was my first real project started in 2019 with a friend.
In this game you are you are alone on an island and you have to collect resources to improve your buildings to survive an approaching storm.
It was coded in Python during about 5 months, we wanted to do our best even if its was difficult, when we started I didn't know anything 
about Python so I had to learn while I was working on the project. 

Here is the repository of the game : https://github.com/Jayllyz/SurvivetheTempest
